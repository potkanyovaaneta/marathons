        <h2>about</h2>
        <p>This project was born from a weird obsession with marathons (and the realization that I’ll probably never run one). But I realized that race routes are actually a great way to <b>see a ton</b> of a city. I built this app to make the race experience accessible to everyone, transforming official marathon courses into curated "travel guides". Now, you can explore the city through the eyes of a runner, just at a much more leisurely pace.</p>        
        <p>The points of interest are curated to offer a mix of the city's best features. To help you navigate, I’ve broken them down into four categories: cultural highlights for a dose of history and art, green spaces when you want a break in nature, different activities and experiences for something fun to do, and culinary spots for food and drinks.</p>
