        <h2>about me</h2>
        <p>hello! i'm a passionate runner and travel enthusiast who believes that marathons are the perfect way to explore a city. there's something magical about experiencing a destination at ground level, at a runner's pace, where you can truly absorb the sights, sounds, and energy of a place.</p>
        <p>after completing marathons across multiple continents, i realized that these routes often showcase the best of what a city has to offer—from iconic landmarks to hidden neighborhoods that tourists might miss. this project was born from a desire to share these experiences and help others discover cities through the unique lens of marathon running.</p>
        <p>whether you're a seasoned marathoner planning your next race destination, or simply curious about exploring cities in a new way, i hope this resource inspires your next adventure.</p>
